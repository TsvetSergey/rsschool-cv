### About me
I work as an engineer in a small company. I am practically not familiar with programming. I tried to learn JS from youtube lessons, but I couldn't spend a lot of time and didn't have enough motivation. I can start from the beginning. I want to implement interesting projects that I sometimes come up with.

#### Skills
I solved the simplest tasks on codewars using JS. GitHub did not study, except for the initial JS skills there is nowhere.

##### Code
function multiply (a, b) {return a*b}

##### Work experience
I have no experience in programming.

###### Education
I watched Bogdanchuk's course on JS on youtube. Solved 8kye problems on codewars

#######
English level A1. I wrote this SM with the help of a translator.
